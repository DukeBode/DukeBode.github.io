[00:00.00]Dear Mr. Wang,

[00:01.00]I am very grateful to have been employed by you for the past two months as an editor for your magazine Design & Fashion. 
[00:11.00]I appreciate the opportunity of having worked here with you and my other colleagues.
[00:17.00]The experiences I had here are ones I will not forget for my entire life.

[00:22.00]However, as a young man whose primary interest is in computer science rather than fashion design, 
[00:29.00]I have found that my present job doesn't fall in with my previous training and strength. 
[00:34.00]I have therefore decided to  quit this job to pursue other opportunities

[00:40.00]that may conform better to my educational background.
[00:45.00]Please accept my sincere apologies for any inconveniences my leaving my cause.
[00:50.00]Yours truly,
[00:52.00]Li Ming
