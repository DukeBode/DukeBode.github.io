### 1.1. 辞职信

{% aplayerlrc "2005" "王江涛" "./static/经典范文001.mp3" %}

[00:00.00]Dear Mr. Wang,

[00:01.00]I am very grateful to have been employed by you for the past two months as an editor for your magazine Design & Fashion. 
[00:11.00]I appreciate the opportunity of having worked here with you and my other colleagues.
[00:17.00]The experiences I had here are ones I will not forget for my entire life.

[00:22.00]However, as a young man whose primary interest is in computer science rather than fashion design, 
[00:29.00]I have found that my present job doesn't fall in with my previous training and strength. 
[00:34.00]I have therefore decided to  quit this job to pursue other opportunities

[00:40.00]that may conform better to my educational background.
[00:45.00]Please accept my sincere apologies for any inconveniences my leaving my cause.
[00:50.00]Yours truly,
[00:52.00]Li Ming

[00:00.00]When we use the word "love", 
[00:05.00]we do not simply mean an attraction to a person of the opposite sex, 
[00:10.00]which is a very narrow definition of the word. 
[00:12.00]The picture below illustrates the real meaning of love, 
[00:17.00]by stressing the fact that love is emotional strength, 
[00:20.00]which can support us no matter how dark the world around us becomes. 
[00:25.00]As a matter of fact, 
[00:27.00]throughout history people of many different cultures have regarded love as the most sublime of human emotions.

[00:35.00]Take an example to illustrate the power of love. 
[00:38.00]We should remember how Chinese people of all nationalities responded to the call to help 
[00:44.00]the victims of the deadly earthquake in Sichuan Province in 2008. 
[00:49.00]Although their incomes were low by international standards, [00:54.00]people all over the country did not hesitate to donate whatever 
[00:59.00]they could ——be it money or goods——to help their needy fellow citizens. 
[01:05.00]Furthermore, they did this with no thought of gain or reward.

[01:09.00]It is my view that the best way to show love is to help people who are more unfortunate than we are. 
[01:16.00]We should always be ready to give a helping hand to those who are in trouble, 
[01:21.00]no matter whether they are family members or complete strangers. 
[01:25.00]Only be doing  so can we help to make the world a better place, 
[01:30.00]for, as the picture shows, 
[01:31.00]the darker the shadows of sorrow become, 
[01:34.00]the more brightly the lamp of love shines.

[00:00.00]The picture vividly depicts a lovely American gilt 
[00:06.00]in traditional Chinese costume with a sweet smile on her face. 
[00:10.00]She wears ribbons, necklaces and other accessories 
[00:14.00]that are characteristic of the clothes of a certain Chinese minority group. 
[00:19.00]Undoubtedly, the costume has added oriental charm to her beautiful features. 

[00:25.00]What the picture conveys goes far beyond merely a new fashion trend. 
[00:30.00]In fact, it carries cultural implications as well. 
[00:34.00]The fact that people from different countries are attracted to 
[00:37.00]the mysterious Chinese culture indicates that 
[00:41.00]to some extent a culture can be accepted, respected, appreciated and shared internationally. 
[00:47.00]In other words, a nation's unique culture can become international 
[00:52.00]through worldwide economic and cultural exchange. 
[00:55.00]Since the trend of globalization has become irresistible, 
[01:01.00]increasing cultural exchange can effectively improve 
[01:04.00]mutual understanding and friendship between countries.

[01:08.00]It is my view that national culture should be preserved and cherished as a priceless spiritual treasure. 
[01:15.00]Meanwhile, there are good reasons to advocate internationalized culture, 
[01:20.00]for those ideas from other cultures, 
[01:23.00]though controversial or even absurd at first sight, 
[01:27.00]can in the long run provide a different perspective for us to observe the world. 
[01:32.00]Nevertheless, when we are confronted with a different culture, 
[01:37.00]we should be sensible enough to absorb its virtues and to resist it dark side. 
[01:43.00]Only in this way can we promote cultural development positively 
[01:47.00]and make our world multidimensional, colorful and vigorous.

[00:00.00]This picture reveals a not-uncommon phenomenon 
[00:05.00]of how elders are treated by their grown-up children in some families in China.
[00:11.00]When they are too old to take care of themselves, 
[00:15.00]the elders become burdens to be kicked around by their sons and daughters like a football, 
[00:20.00]a pitiful and unjust sight that has aroused indignation among many Chinese.

[00:26.00]As a nation renowned worldwide for its may virtues, 
[00:30.00]China and the Chinese people have been practicing filial piety throughout history. 
[00:36.00]Many often-told stories reiterate this time-honored virtue of loving and respecting the elders, 
[00:44.00]such as the story of Tidying in the Western Han Dynasty 
[00:47.00]who risked her life in order to save her wronged father from corporal punishment. 
[00:53.00]Those who try every means to avoid their duties of looking after their elders should bear in mind 
[01:01.00]that they are much indebted to their parents for their rearing. 
[01:04.00]Without the loving care and selfless devotion of their parents, 
[01:09.00]how could they have grown up healthily and become successful? 
[01:12.00]How is it possible for them to maltreat their parents without the pricks of conscience?

[01:18.00]Every one of us should live up to the virtues passed down to us by our ancestors. 
[01:24.00]Only in this way can we be worthy of the name  of a Chinese.
