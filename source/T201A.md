### 1.1. 辞职信

{% aplayerlrc "2005" "王江涛" "./static/经典范文001.mp3" %}

[00:00.00]Dear Mr. Wang,

[00:01.00]I am very grateful to have been employed by you for the past two months as an editor for your magazine Design & Fashion. 
[00:11.00]I appreciate the opportunity of having worked here with you and my other colleagues.
[00:17.00]The experiences I had here are ones I will not forget for my entire life.

[00:22.00]However, as a young man whose primary interest is in computer science rather than fashion design, 
[00:29.00]I have found that my present job doesn't fall in with my previous training and strength. 
[00:34.00]I have therefore decided to  quit this job to pursue other opportunities

[00:40.00]that may conform better to my educational background.
[00:45.00]Please accept my sincere apologies for any inconveniences my leaving my cause.
[00:50.00]Yours truly,
[00:52.00]Li Ming

[00:00.00]Dear Sir or Madam,

[00:03.00]I bought an electronic dictionary from your online store on January 1st, 
[00:09.00]but after using it for a short period of time, 
[0012.00]I found it has some problems.

[00:14.00]To begin with, 
[00:15.00]the battery needs recharging after a mere 2 hours of use. 
[00:19.00]This means that I need  to carry my charger with me when I go out for a day. 
[00:24.00]In addition, the buttons on the electronic dictionary  are so small 
[00:19.00]that it is nearly impossible to type anything with them. 
[00:33.00]Personally, I find this to be completely unacceptable.

[00:37.00]Therefore, I would like either to change for another model that works better or a full refund. 
[00:44.00]Your help is greatly appreciated.

[00:47.00]Yours sincerely,

### 2.1. 爱

{% aplayerlrc "2001" "王江涛" "./static/经典范文045.mp3" %}

[00:00.00]When we use the word "love", 
[00:05.00]we do not simply mean an attraction to a person of the opposite sex, 
[00:10.00]which is a very narrow definition of the word. 
[00:12.00]The picture below illustrates the real meaning of love, 
[00:17.00]by stressing the fact that love is emotional strength, 
[00:20.00]which can support us no matter how dark the world around us becomes. 
[00:25.00]As a matter of fact, 
[00:27.00]throughout history people of many different cultures have regarded love as the most sublime of human emotions.

[00:35.00]Take an example to illustrate the power of love. 
[00:38.00]We should remember how Chinese people of all nationalities responded to the call to help 
[00:44.00]the victims of the deadly earthquake in Sichuan Province in 2008. 
[00:49.00]Although their incomes were low by international standards, [00:54.00]people all over the country did not hesitate to donate whatever 
[00:59.00]they could ——be it money or goods——to help their needy fellow citizens. 
[01:05.00]Furthermore, they did this with no thought of gain or reward.

[01:09.00]It is my view that the best way to show love is to help people who are more unfortunate than we are. 
[01:16.00]We should always be ready to give a helping hand to those who are in trouble, 
[01:21.00]no matter whether they are family members or complete strangers. 
[01:25.00]Only be doing  so can we help to make the world a better place, 
[01:30.00]for, as the picture shows, 
[01:31.00]the darker the shadows of sorrow become, 
[01:34.00]the more brightly the lamp of love shines.

{% endaplayerlrc %}

{% spoiler 核心词汇 %}
- attraction n. 吸引；爱慕；向往的地方；有吸引力的事
- opposite adj. 相反的；对面的；另一边的；迥然不同的 n. 对立的人（或物）；对立面，反面
- illustrate vt. 阐释；（用示例、图画等）说明，阐明；给……加插图

### 2.2. 传统文化

{% aplayerlrc "2002" "王江涛" "./static/经典范文046.mp3" %}

[00:00.00]The picture vividly depicts a lovely American gilt 
[00:06.00]in traditional Chinese costume with a sweet smile on her face. 
[00:10.00]She wears ribbons, necklaces and other accessories 
[00:14.00]that are characteristic of the clothes of a certain Chinese minority group. 
[00:19.00]Undoubtedly, the costume has added oriental charm to her beautiful features. 

[00:25.00]What the picture conveys goes far beyond merely a new fashion trend. 
[00:30.00]In fact, it carries cultural implications as well. 
[00:34.00]The fact that people from different countries are attracted to 
[00:37.00]the mysterious Chinese culture indicates that 
[00:41.00]to some extent a culture can be accepted, respected, appreciated and shared internationally. 
[00:47.00]In other words, a nation's unique culture can become international 
[00:52.00]through worldwide economic and cultural exchange. 
[00:55.00]Since the trend of globalization has become irresistible, 
[01:01.00]increasing cultural exchange can effectively improve 
[01:04.00]mutual understanding and friendship between countries.

[01:08.00]It is my view that national culture should be preserved and cherished as a priceless spiritual treasure. 
[01:15.00]Meanwhile, there are good reasons to advocate internationalized culture, 
[01:20.00]for those ideas from other cultures, 
[01:23.00]though controversial or even absurd at first sight, 
[01:27.00]can in the long run provide a different perspective for us to observe the world. 
[01:32.00]Nevertheless, when we are confronted with a different culture, 
[01:37.00]we should be sensible enough to absorb its virtues and to resist it dark side. 
[01:43.00]Only in this way can we promote cultural development positively 
[01:47.00]and make our world multidimensional, colorful and vigorous.

### 2.3. 孝敬父母

{% aplayerlrc "2005" "王江涛" "./static/经典范文047.mp3" %}

[00:00.00]This picture reveals a not-uncommon phenomenon 
[00:05.00]of how elders are treated by their grown-up children in some families in China.
[00:11.00]When they are too old to take care of themselves, 
[00:15.00]the elders become burdens to be kicked around by their sons and daughters like a football, 
[00:20.00]a pitiful and unjust sight that has aroused indignation among many Chinese.

[00:26.00]As a nation renowned worldwide for its may virtues, 
[00:30.00]China and the Chinese people have been practicing filial piety throughout history. 
[00:36.00]Many often-told stories reiterate this time-honored virtue of loving and respecting the elders, 
[00:44.00]such as the story of Tidying in the Western Han Dynasty 
[00:47.00]who risked her life in order to save her wronged father from corporal punishment. 
[00:53.00]Those who try every means to avoid their duties of looking after their elders should bear in mind 
[01:01.00]that they are much indebted to their parents for their rearing. 
[01:04.00]Without the loving care and selfless devotion of their parents, 
[01:09.00]how could they have grown up healthily and become successful? 
[01:12.00]How is it possible for them to maltreat their parents without the pricks of conscience?

[01:18.00]Every one of us should live up to the virtues passed down to us by our ancestors. 
[01:24.00]Only in this way can we be worthy of the name  of a Chinese.

### 2.4. 偶像崇拜

{% aplayerlrc "2006" "王江涛" "./static/经典范文048.mp3" %}

[00:00.00]As is vividly depicted in the photos above, Beckham, 
[00:00.00]the smart British football superstar, is enjoying a striking among adolescents. 
[00:00.00]In the first picture, Beckham's name appears on a young man's face. 
[00:00.00]The caption indicates that worship for an idol is written on his face. 
[00:00.00]In the second photograph, 
[00:00.00]another young person is in a barbershop getting his hair cut in Beckham's chic style, 
[00:00.00]We are informed that he is spending 300 yuan imitating his idol's haircut.

[00:00.00]Undoubtedly, the pictures subtly reflect the social phenomenon of idol worship prevalent among teenagers nowadays. 
[00:00.00]Briefly speaking, young people are inclined to idolize the people who excel in appearance, intelligence or talent. 
[00:00.00]Beckham represents the image of a sports hero, 
[00:00.00]whose handsome appearance and unparalleled football skills are passionately adored by all the sports fans. 
[00:00.00]Likewise, several teenage girls won their fame overnight in the 2005 Super Girls contest in China, 
[00:00.00]which provoked noisy nationwide debate on the value and harm of admiring these idols.

[00:00.00]In my opinion, idolatry, a thought-provoking social phenomenon, 
[00:00.00]is a double-edged sword which can exert profound influence for either good or bad  on the growth of young people. 
[00:00.00]If we simply worship idols by imitating their hairstytle or pursuing fashions unreasonably, 
[00:00.00]the obsession will certainly waste a great deal of our time and money, 
[00:00.00]endangering the efficiency of our study or work. 
[00:00.00]On the contrary, if we endeavor th improve ourselves by bridging the gap between our models and us, 
[00:00.00]we will lead a positive and fruitful life. 
[00:00.00]Accordingly, the latter attitude should be adopted to direct out way of life.

### 2.5. 自信

{% aplayerlrc "2007" "王江涛" "./static/经典范文049.mp3" %}

[00:00.00]It is symbolically illustrated in the cartoon that a striker is preparing to shoot at the goal defended by a goalkeeper on a football field. 
[00:00.00]In the goalkeeper's mind, 
[00:00.00]he is so much smaller than he actually is that guarding the goal becomes an impossible mission. 
[00:00.00]At the same time, 
[00:00.00]the giant guard seems to fill up the whole goal in the attacking player's mind.

[00:00.00]The purpose of the drawing is to show us that in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges or predicaments, 
[00:00.00]possessing self-confidence is of the utmost significance. 
[00:00.00]Regardless of how much success on has had in school or at work, 
[00:00.00]there are bound to be times when he or she will encounter problems. 
[00:00.00]It is at these critical times that one's self-confidence, 
[00:00.00]toward difficulty and toward life in general, 
[00:00.00]plays a crucial role in determining whether he or she can turn failure into victory.

[00:00.00]I can think of no better illustration than the following one. Helen Keller was deaf and blind, certainly nothing to give her self-confidence. 
[00:00.00]Nevertheless, she went on to conquer her multiple handicaps to finally become a writer and lecturer, and inspiration to all. 
[00:00.00]This case effectively illustrates that no matter what tasks we are confronted with, we should never overestimate the difficulties or underestimate our abilities.

### 2.6. 网络

{% aplayerlrc "2009" "王江涛" "./static/经典范文050.mp3" %}

[00:00.00]As is symbolically illustrated in the cartoon, a large number of people are surfing on line within a stretching spider web, 
[00:00.00]either to entertain themselves or to meet the needs of work. 
[00:00.00]It seems rather ironic to present people separated from cach other by the spider web when they attempt to communicate. 
[00:00.00]Undoubtedly, the spider web serves as a symbol of the Internet, 
[00:00.00]both connecting people and isolating them from each other.

[00:00.00]The impressive metaphorical portrayal subtly reveals the duality of the relationship between man and the Internet. 
[00:00.00]On the one hand, there is no denying that the Internet is currently one of the most different media used for interpersonal communication. 
[00:00.00]As a college student, 
[00:00.00]I get on line every day to discuss news with other people on BBS, 
[00:00.00]to study English by registering for web courses, 
[00:00.00]and to chat freely with my friends though MSN Messenger. 
[00:00.00]But on the other hand, 
[00:00.00]a good many people admit that they are too addicted to the Internet to maintain face-to-face contact with their friends and colleagues. 
[00:00.00]Once having indulged in the fictitious world, 
[00:00.00]people feel reluctant to approach others and to concentrate on real reluctant to approach others and to concentrate on real life. 
[00:00.00]That's why some people have lost the skill of direct contact and become alienated from others.

[00:00.00]Hence, it is necessary for us to use the Internet in a reasonable way and refrain from overindulgence. 
[00:00.00]After all, the Internet was invented to connect you and me, 
[00:00.00]and to bring conveniences to our life rather than setting barriers to keep people beyond reach.

### 2.7. 环境保护

{% aplayerlrc "2011" "王江涛" "./static/经典范文051.mp3" %}

[00:00.00]As is subtly portrayed in the cartoon, two tourists are sightseeing on a small boat while discarding their picnic leftovers casually into a lake. 
[00:00.00]Unfortunately, the lake is already filled with litter and teeming with flowing rubbish like plastic containers, fish bones,  banana peels,  watermelon rinds, bottles, tins, food wrappings, and so on. 
[00:00.00]And below the drawing, there is a caption which says: "after" the travel or "me" in the travel.

[00:00.00]From the portrayal, we can conclude that the painter wants to convey such a message: a good many scenic spots are flooded with visitors, who spoil the beauty of nature by creating and leaving behind God-knows-how-much trash. 
[00:00.00]On the one hand, tourism, as a multibillion-dollar business, is booming everywhere. Some people , under the belief that tourism serves as an engine of economic growth, seem to ignore its negative effects on the environment. 
[00:00.00]Nevertheless, these are not concerns that we can shrug off lightly. 
[00:00.00]On the other hand, tourism has exerted great pressure on the environment we are living in: our water is polluted,  our ecological system is disturbed, and our natural resources have been excessively used.

[00:00.00]Undoubtedly, tourism cannot be handed in any country, as it does help to shore up the economy in places which have few sources of income. 
[00:00.00]However, the main point is that the unchecked growth of the travel business may render the development of an economy unsustainable. It is high time that we enhanced people's awareness to rectify this by taking environmental protection into consideration.

### 2.8. MBA 条形图

{% aplayerlrc "2006" "王江涛" "./static/经典范文052.mp3" %}

[00:00.00]The diagram above clearly illustrates that a dramatic increase has occurred in the recruitment of Masters of Engineering(ME) in China during the past seven years. 
[00:00.00]According to the statistics given above, we may conclude that the recruitment of MEs was on a steady rise from 1998 to 2004. 
[00:00.00]In 1998, the number was at a low of only about 2,500. Surprisingly, it reached more than 35,000 in 2004, within no more than seven years.

[00:00.00]Some driving factors that contribute to the above-mentioned change may be summarized as follows. 
[00:00.00]First and foremost, China has become particularly active in manufacturing, which has led to an increased demand for qualified engineers. 
[00:00.00]In addition, the development of the job market on the whole cannot keep pace with the expansion of college graduates, which has obliged a large number of students to stay on campus for another three years to get better prepared for their careers. 
[00:00.00]Last but not least, working pressure is another reason. 
[00:00.00]Taking all these factors into account, we may predict that with the speedy development of our society, 
[00:00.00]the recruitment of MEs will keep growing in the forthcoming decade.

[00:00.00]On the other side of the coin, however, this tendency may bring about a good many problems, such as the waste of talent. It is necessary for us to take effective measures to ensure this situation doesn't get out of hand, and encourage students to choose majors for which both theoretical knowledge an practical skills will be demanded in the job market.

### 2.9. 饼状图

{% aplayerlrc "2018" "王江涛" "./static/经典范文053.mp3" %}

[00:00.00]The pie chart above clearly reveals the factors of consumers' concern on choosing restaurants in a certain city in 2017. 
[00:00.00]Among all the five categories, the percentages of feature, service and environment are the highest, accounting for 36.3%, 26.8% and 23.8% respectively. 
[00:00.00]On the contrary, the statistics of price and other factors take up merely 8.4% and 4.7% respectively, the lowest among the five groups.

[00:00.00]Several primary causes that contributed to the above-mentioned phenomenon could be summarized as follows. In the first place, with the prosperity of economy in China and the increase of people's income in recent decades, a large number of people are paying more attention to the features of a restaurant instead of prices. In the second place, in a bid to develop interpersonal relationship and enjoy comfortable life, consumers in mounting numbers prefer service and environment to other factors.

[00:00.00]With due consideration of all these contributors, we may predict that with the speedy development of our society, customers in expanding numbers will attach utmost significance to the feature, service as well as environment of a restaurant rather than prices or other factors.

### 2.10. 材料作文

{% aplayerlrc "2023" "王江涛" "./static/经典范文054.mp3" %}

[00:00.00]At present, some of us fear that communicating uncertainty is detrimental to us. 
[00:00.00]In this excerpt, the writer argues that the majority of people are inclined to trust those who are honest. 
[00:00.00]I agree with the author's idea. 

[00:00.00]Honesty is the most important characteristic for success in life. Only by consistently proving himself honest can a person earn the precious trust of family members an business partners. 
[00:00.00]In the business word, for instance, people without honesty sooner or later earn the bad reputation they deserve. 
[00:00.00]I have observed how destructive a certain person's dishonesty has been to his chances for success, and how his relationships with other people are purely superficial, based only on self-interest.

[00:00.00]Honesty is a very valuable asset, which is easy to lose but hard to gain. In the long run, an honest person will earn the love and respect of the people closest to him or her, which, in my opinion, is the greatest measure of a successful life. Just as an old saying goes, "It takes years to build trust, and a few seconds to destroy it."
